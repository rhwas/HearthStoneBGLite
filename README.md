# HearthStoneBGLite
HearthStoneBGLite aims to simulate the mechanics of HearthStone Battlegrounds. The purpose is to create a near identical copy in which it can be used to run simulations and be used for machine learning/reinforcement learning purposes. This is an individual effort and learning activity.
